https://jfin-swufe.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40854-016-0034-9

Blockchain technology is a core, underlying technology with promising application prospects in the banking industry. On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards

Briefly, Block-chain technology is a technology in which digital information is stored in a public shared data-base. This technology got famous mainly after introducing the first cryptocurrency which is the Bitcoin. The bitcoin uses this technology in keep tracking the records securely. First, this paper will give a brief idea about blockchain generally and show how it works. Then, it will discuss some general applications of blockchain. In addition to making a mini-review of this technology generally and especially in the banking industry. Like other services and products, which have been completely changed because of “digitalization and technology”, such as; shopping, ordering and delivering food, movies and TV industry, navigation services… etc. Blockchain can completely change and transform the banking services because it has High security, high transaction transparency, decentralized system and can achieve transactions more efficiently. In addition, the correlation between blockchain technology, Fin-Techs and sustainability will be discussed. Finally, the expected future and the challenges of accepting and implementing blockchain technology in the financial industry and services will be discussed.

Blockchain is thought to be the most recent innovation in technology. Trust is especially important in areas like the banking sector. Blockchain technology is a decentralised, coded security system which permits the development of novel digital platforms and services using this developing technology. The current research focuses on the usage of blockchain technology in the financial and e-finance sectors. The study focuses of research questions such as the development of blockchain technology, the adoption & challenges in blockchain technology and the application of blockchain technology in the financial sector. This study conducted a systematic review of 76 scientific articles on blockchain technology, narrowing down the selection to 59 articles. As a result, the author created classification framework with three dimensions: blockchain development, challenges and applications in the financial sector. This study recognizes consequences for blockchain research and practice in the future. The study reveals that blockchain has various unexplored application in finance sector and also there is a scope of improvement in technology. Also, the technology is unregulated, thus, it is still in its nascent stage and a lot is to be done in the field.
